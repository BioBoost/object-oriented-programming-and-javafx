# Object Oriented Programming and JavaFX

Welcome to the course Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and JavaFX.

Most of the material used in this course is created by Nico De Witte. However some paragraphs, definitions, examples, images, ... may be copied from other online sources. In that case a reference can be found in the Sources chapter or as a footnote.

## Alpha version

Please note that this GitBook is still under development and did not even reach a draft version yet. Make sure to check at least every week for changes made.

## Prerequisites

This course does expect you to already have a basic knowledge of programming with Java and object oriented concepts. If you don't please take the course "Object Oriented Programming with Java" which can be found at https://bioboost.gitbooks.io/object-oriented-programming-using-java/content/.

## Requirements

To follow along you will need to install Java and NetBeans

## About this course

[todo]

### Theory

While all you need to know for the exam is in this course, not all you should know is in here. It is extremely preferable to take notes in the lessons. And of course you are also encouraged to search the Internet and books for extra knowledge.

Feel free to ask questions in the lessons, via email or via slack.

### LABs, assignments and tests

The LABs are there to practice what you have learned in the theory lessons. You will get some assignments through the semester on which you will be graded.

This course also contains extra exercises to practice your OOP skills in either Java or C++ (or another language of your preference).

There may be occasions for tests but these will mostly be announced.

### ECTS

For the exact details on the LABs, exams and tests you should take a look at the ECTS fiche of this course.
