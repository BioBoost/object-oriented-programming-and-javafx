## Second Button

Take the hello world application and try adding a second button to the application that outputs "I am HAL" to the console when the user presses it.

If you make use of the StackPane only the last added button to the pane will be shown. That is why you should replace the StackPane with for example a FlowPane.

## Nine buttons keypad

Create an application that has 9 buttons ordered like a keypad as shown in the image below.

Simply output a message to the console that a button was pressed. You do not have to worry about identifying which button was actually pressed.
Make sure to create the nine buttons using a for-loop. Do not manually instantiate 9 buttons.
