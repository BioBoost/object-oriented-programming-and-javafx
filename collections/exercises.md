# Exercises

## Telephone book

Create a small application (console application) that first asks the user for a name and next a telephone number. Store both as key/values in a hashmap. Do this until the user decides to stop (for example typing "exit" or "stop"). Print the list of keys and their accompanied values to the terminal.

## Searching in telephone book

Extend the "Telephone book" exercise by asking the user after his input to type a name and lookup the telephone number of that person.
Try to make sure that if the name is not listed to generate a message for the user.
